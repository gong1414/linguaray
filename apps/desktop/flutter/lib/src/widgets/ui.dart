/// The app's single door to the design system.
///
/// Pages and widgets import this file, never `package:linguaray_ui/…`
/// directly, so the package stays swappable from one place. Import only the
/// names a file actually uses:
///
/// ```dart
/// import '../../widgets/ui.dart' show Button, ButtonVariant;
/// ```
///
/// The package holds primitives only. The product's own widgets that compose
/// them sit beside this file (`swap_pair.dart`, `blocks.dart`,
/// `list_tile.dart`, …) and are imported directly, not through here.
///
/// Several of the exported names (`Divider`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Dialog`,
/// `Badge`, `Checkbox`) collide with Material's. When a file shows one of those
/// and also imports Material, hide Material's — for example
/// `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Divider;`.
///
/// Reaching for `context.colors` / `context.tokens` / `context.typography`
/// means showing the extension that carries them, `DesignThemeContext`; the
/// type recipes (`sansStyle`, `labelStyle`, …) come from
/// `DesignTypographyStyles`.
