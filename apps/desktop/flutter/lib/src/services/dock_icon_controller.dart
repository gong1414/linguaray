/// LinguaRay ships as a menu bar app (`LSUIElement` in Info.plist), so it
/// launches without either. Two situations promote it to a regular app:
///
///   * **the workbench window is on screen** — it needs a Dock icon to be
///     reachable through ⌘-Tab, Mission Control and the Dock, and it needs the
///     menu bar for ⌘, ⌘W and ⌘Q;
///   * **the tray icon is turned off** — otherwise the app would have no
///     visible entry point at all, and the only way back would be a global
///     shortcut the user may never have set.
///
/// The mini translator deliberately does *not* promote. It is a popover
/// anchored under the tray icon that closes as soon as it loses focus, and
/// flashing a Dock icon on every quick translation is worse than going without
/// a menu bar for the seconds it is open — its text fields handle the editing
/// shortcuts themselves (see `NativeTextFieldPlugin.performKeyEquivalent`).
///
/// Only macOS distinguishes the two policies, so everything here is a no-op
/// elsewhere.
